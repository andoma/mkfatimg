  buffered io on directories
  clarify drive->ops interface (eg. return value...)
  where ro check (will_write)?
  prohibit short names with spaces (invent name?)
  frag offsets in sectors
  do something with byte offset units
  info sector (fat32)
  long name handling switches in img open
  add buffered.c working on whole sectors
  add guescp.c???: read config.sys, use Country=048,852
  force directory 2MB limit
  rethink shutdown procedure (too many drive_syncs)
  fopen with 'a' flag (force append?)
  drive dirty flag (in FAT)
